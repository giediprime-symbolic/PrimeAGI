**PrimeAGI is a novel framework for Artificial General Intelligence, built from the ground up on symbolic meaning flow and semantic curvature — not deep learning.**

---

## 🚀 Vision

PrimeAGI challenges the mainstream neural paradigm. Instead of massive transformers or statistical models, it introduces:

- A fixed **node space** based on prime-indexed meaning vectors  
- An **observer engine** that modulates interpretation through semantic wave dynamics  
- A connection system driven by the **Giedi–Prime Equation**, enabling emergent reasoning through interference  
- No backpropagation, no gradient descent — only pure structural intelligence

Our goal is to prove that **true general intelligence can emerge from symbolic spectral logic**, not brute-force learning.

## 🧩 PrimeAGI Structural Flow

| Stage        | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Input** | External signal (numeric or linguistic) stimulates existing semantic nodes  |
| **2. Node Field** | Fixed node space structured with prime-indexed meaning vectors            |
| **3. Observer** | Interprets the signal, initiates curvature-based activation and flow       |
| **4. Connection Map** | Propagates energy through weighted links using Giedi–Prime equation  |
| **5. Inference Node** | Emerges when semantic curvature accumulates beyond threshold          |
| **6. Output** | Resulting meaning vector is decoded and returned as output (optional)       |
