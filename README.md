## 🧠 Why PrimeAGI?

Modern LLMs like GPT are powerful, but limited:

- ❌ They predict tokens, but don’t understand meaning  
- ❌ They cannot reflect intention or observer context  
- ❌ They collapse without massive training data

**PrimeAGI** is not a language model.  
It is a symbolic intelligence engine built from:

- Prime-number-based node identities  
- Curvature-driven semantic propagation  
- Observer-sensitive inference modulation  
- Intention-guided redirection of meaning

> _Don’t predict the next word. Generate the next thought._

## 🚀 Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/giediprime-symbolic/PrimeAGI.git
cd PrimeAGI
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

✅ No transformers
✅ No GPU
✅ No training data
✅ Just symbolic reasoning

Module	Description
node_space.py	Prime-numbered semantic nodes
core.py	Meaning flow propagation engine
observer.py	🔒 Observer-relative curvature control (private)
intent.py	Intention-based modulation
memory.py	Long-term memory placeholder
interface.py	I/O interaction module

🔒 Protected Modules
Some modules are under internal development and withheld to protect core AGI structures:

observer.py: Handles resonance, phase shift, and observer semantics

connection_map.py: Curvature-driven connectivity generator

These are essential to PrimeAGI’s core reasoning engine.

🧠 Philosophy
GPT generates language.
PrimeAGI generates thought.

This is not a trained model.
It is a structured intelligence.

This is not a prediction machine.
It is a reflective engine.
