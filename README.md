# ðŸ§  PrimeAGI

**PrimeAGI is a novel framework for Artificial General Intelligence, built from the ground up on symbolic meaning flow and semantic curvature â€” not deep learning.**

---

## ðŸš€ Vision

PrimeAGI challenges the mainstream neural paradigm. Instead of massive transformers or statistical models, it introduces:

- A fixed **node space** based on prime-indexed meaning vectors  
- An **observer engine** that modulates interpretation through semantic wave dynamics  
- A connection system driven by the **Giediâ€“Prime Equation**, enabling emergent reasoning through interference  
- No backpropagation, no gradient descent â€” only pure structural intelligence

Our goal is to prove that **true general intelligence can emerge from symbolic spectral logic**, not brute-force learning.

> "PrimeAGI doesn't simulate intelligence. It grows meaning."
